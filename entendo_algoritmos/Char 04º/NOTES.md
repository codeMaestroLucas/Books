# Quicksort

Sort algorithm â‡’ Divide and Conquer.

_Recursion method._

Steps:

1. Base-case: the normal and easiest problem;
2. Divide or reduce your problem until you find the solution.

ðŸ“Œ In the **worst scenario** the Quicksort Big O notation is executed in a $O(n^2)$.

In a normal scenario it takes $O(n *log (n))$.

OBS: These scenarios vary depending on the choice of the pivot.

This worst scenario happens when the array already is sorted and u just get the first element. This make one of the Arrays to be always empty.
